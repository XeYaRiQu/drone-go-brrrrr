# Drone go brrrr

Welcome to our GitHub repository for EE4002D AY23/24!


## Project Roles:
Hardware design         - @XeYaRiQu

Software implementation - @ShreshthSarda

Simulation & tuning     - @ieaxls

Theoretical analysis    - @jersst


## Deliverables:
1. Testbed
2. Multirotor
3. Simulator
4. Report


## Tasks:
- [x] Literature review
- [x] Finalise testbed design
- [x] Purchase components
- [x] Assemble testbed
- [ ] Assemble multirotor
- [ ] Set up simulation infrastructure
- [ ] Get preliminary simulation
- [ ] Perform test flight

## Workflow:
main - All finalised and validated work (code, designs, etc.) will be checked-in here by creating a PR from the dev branch.

dev - Primary development branch.
